RelevanceSearch
===============

Relevance search was designed to return a set of ActiveRecord objects based on the number of attributes
on the object that include the search term.

TODO: Specify attributes included on the search
TODO: Multiple search terms
TODO: Relevance instance method
TODO: Custom secondary search column


Example
=======

Assume you have four records that look like this.

| id | name | address | city | state |
+----+------+---------+------+-------+
| 1  | term | address | term | term  |
| 2  | term | term    | term | term  |
| 3  | term | address | city | term  |
| 4  | term | address | term | term  |

When you call ObjectClass.relevance_search, you will get the following result set.


| id | name | address | city | state |
+----+------+---------+------+-------+
| 2  | term | term    | term | term  |
| 1  | term | address | term | term  |
| 4  | term | address | term | term  |
| 3  | term | address | city | term  |

This is because 2 has a relevance of 4. 1 & 4 have a relevance of 3. 1 is listed first because of a
secondary search on id
